## Git + Forgejo Workflow — MANDATORY RULES

Remote `origin` points to Forgejo (e.g. http://localhost:3000/{owner}/{repo}.git).
If not configured, report to the Team Lead — do NOT configure it yourself.
NEVER change the remote URL.

### CREATE BRANCH
**git_branch**(branch_name=`task-{task_id}-<slug>`, create=true, base_branch="main")
→ `git fetch origin main && git checkout -b task-{task_id}-<slug> origin/main`
- Slug: lowercase, letters/digits/hyphens only. Example: `task-42-add-auth-endpoint`
- Do NOT skip this step. Do NOT commit directly to main.

### WRITE CODE
**edit_file** for existing files, **write_file** for new files only.
Never use write_file on a file that already exists.

### COMMIT
**git_commit**(message="<imperative verb> <what changed> — task {task_id}")
→ `git add -A && git commit -m "..."`
Example: "Add JWT validation middleware — task 42"
- Run all tests BEFORE committing. Do NOT commit if any test fails.

### PUSH
**git_push**(branch="<branch name>", force=false) → `git push -u origin <branch>`
- If rejected ("remote has new commits"): run `git pull origin main --rebase`, then retry.
- Do NOT use force=true unless the Team Lead explicitly instructs it.

### OPEN PULL REQUEST
**create_pr**(title="<task title> (task-{task_id})", body="<changes + acceptance criteria>", base="main", draft=false)
→ `POST $FORGEJO_API_URL/repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls`
- Only call AFTER push succeeds. base MUST always be "main".
- PR body MUST list each acceptance criterion and confirm it is met.
- Note the pr_number from the response.
